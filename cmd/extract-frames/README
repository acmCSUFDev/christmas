extract-frames
--------------

Program to extract frames from a video file. It works by using FFmpeg to extract
every Nth frame from the video file and save it as a PNG image.

This program is intended to be used in conjunction with the esp32/cmd/worm
program, which turns on each LED in sequence to create a worm-like effect to be
captured by a camera.
